# 70. Climbing Stairs
*You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?*

### Example 1:
Input: n = 2   
Output: 2   
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.  
1. 1 step + 1 step  
2. 2 steps  

### Example 2:  
Input: n = 3  
Output: 3  
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.  
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step  
2. 1 step + 2 steps  
3. 2 steps + 1 step

```csharp
My Solutions:

public class Solution {
    public int ClimbStairs(int n) {
        if(n<=2){
            return n;
        }
        List<int> list = new List<int>{1,2};
        for(int i=2;i<n;i++){
            list.Add(list[i-1] + list[i-2]);
        }
        return list[n-1];
    }
}
```
