# 2085. Count Common Words With One Occurrence

*Q . Given two string arrays words1 and words2, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.*
### Example 1:  
Input: words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]  
Output: 2  
Explanation:  
- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.  
- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.  
- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.  
- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.  
Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.  
### Example 2:  
Input: words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]  
Output: 0  
Explanation: There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.  
### Example 3:  
Input: words1 = ["a","ab"], words2 = ["a","a","a","ab"]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".

```javascript
My Solution :

  /**
 * @param {string[]} words1
 * @param {string[]} words2
 * @return {number}
 */
var countWords = function(words1, words2) {
    let count=0;
    for (let i=0;i<words1.length;i++){
        let duplicate1 = words1.filter((val)=>val === words1[i])
        let duplicate = words2.filter((val)=>val === words1[i])

        if(duplicate.length === 1 && duplicate1.length === 1 ){
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
};
```
