# 496. Next Greater Element I
*The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.
You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.
For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, 
then the answer for this query is -1.
Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.*

## Example 1:   
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]  
Output: [-1,3,-1]  
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:  
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.   
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.  
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.  

## Example 2:  
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]  
Output: [3,-1]  
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:  
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.  
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

            for(int j=0;j<nums2.Length;j++){
                if(nums1[i] == nums2[j]){
                    grater = nums1[i];
                }
                if(grater != null && nums2[j] > grater){

                    break;
                }
                else if(j==nums2.Length-1){
                    list.Add(-1);
                }
            }
        }
        return list.ToArray();
    }
